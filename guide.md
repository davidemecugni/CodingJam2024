# Guide
This guide will use VSCode as it's main IDE.

## 1 Pull the branch from GitHub using the GitHub CLI.
(For Linux: https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)
(For Windows **winget install --id GitHub.cli**)

## 2 Pull the branch
```
gh repo clone davidemecugni/CodingJam2024
```

## 3 Contribute using GitHub and Git VSCODE GUI
Click on main and Create new branch
![Branch1](/photos/1.png)
Give the branch a meaningful name such as "CSV-reader"
![Branch2](/photos/2.png)
Write the code and commit it using the GUI giving a meaningful message such as "CSV reader function for exercise 2".
![Branch3](/photos/3.png)
After one or more commits pull on your branch giving a description such as "Complete CSV reader function and helper file".
![Branch4](/photos/4.png)
After publishing head up to GitHub and create a pull request.
![Branch5](/photos/5.png)
If necessary add a message.
![Branch6](/photos/6.png)
If the branch has no conficts with the base branch you(**or preferably someone else**) can merge the branch in main.
![Branch7](/photos/7.png)
After that your code has been merged in main and your work is done.
You may still add changes on your branch following the same procedure.
