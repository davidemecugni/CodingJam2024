(For Windows **winget install --id GitHub.cli**)

## 2 Pull the branch
```
gh repo clone davidemecugni/CodingJam2024
```

## 3 Create a branch using the VSCode GUI
Click on main and Create new branch
![Branch1](/photos/1.png)
Give the branch a meaningful name such as "CSV-reader"
![Branch2](/photos/2.png)
Write the code and commit it using the GUI giving a meaningful message such as "CSV reader function for exercise 2".

After one or more commits pull on your branch.
